# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning.

- Built using **pretrained CNN models in ONNX format**.
- Utilized **SCRFD** for efficient face detection and a **custom classifier** for mask recognition.
- Integrated **OpenCV** and **NumPy** for preprocessing, inference, and annotation.

> Detects faces and classifies them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask" in real-time.
